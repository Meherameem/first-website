       <h2>Why Alan Rickman</h2>
       <p>
        I would never knew him if it wasn't for harry potter. I knew him as grumpy Professor Snape and hated him always for being such a jackass towards harry and his friends.But at the very last book of Harry Potter , I got to learn about True Severus Snape.He won my heart. I cried so much for him . He is a symbol of sacrifice, love and loyality to me. I think nobody in this world could ever love Lily the selfless way he did. And I think nobody could possibly represent Severus Snape charecter as good as Alan Rickman did. Along with acting Professor Snape, I loved Alan too. He will remain in my heart always a symbol of true love,sacrifice,loyality,intelligence and true heroism.
